"""
Test suite for Enhanced Resume Features

This test suite covers all the new functionality added to the resume system:
1. Job Section Updates (city dropdown, nature of work, employment type)
2. Work Experience (responsibilities/achievements split)
3. Projects (type, tools, role, responsibilities, outcomes)
4. Education (GPA, rank fields)
5. Social Media URL validation

Run with: python -m pytest tests/test_enhanced_resume.py -v
