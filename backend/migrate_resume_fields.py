Database Migration Script for Enhanced Resume Fields

This script migrates existing resume data to include new fields:
- Work Experience: Split description into responsibilities and achievements
- Projects: Add project_type, tools, responsibilities, outcomes fields  
- Education: Add gpa and rank fields

Run this script after deploying the new model updates.
